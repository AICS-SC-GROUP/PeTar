sdissue.flyby: one flyby pass a binary, the timescale criterion depending on radial velocity has inverse peak near peri-center, which cause big energy jump, by using full velocity instead of radial. the problem is solved. : -k 1e-5
sdissue.flyby2: two binary flyby, the slowdown timescale decrease too slow before the energy error increase too much, use acceleration in timescale calculation help : -k 1e-5
sdissue.flyby3: two large slowdown factor when B-B encounter appear, use acc^2 instead of m*r^-4 help : -k 1e-5
sdissue.triple: stable triple case: -k 1e-5
sdissue.tscale: a wide binary pass by cause oscillation of timescale, use 1/r weighted dr/dv : -k 1e-5
arerr:  3-body AR get large error due to fix step, use better fix step criterion (depending on apo-out/peri-in) : -k 1e-5
ar.ds:  3-body AR get very small initial ds due to large energy_error with soft perturbation. Replace energy check by using error of extended H is better : -k 1e-5
#6body: 4-body strong encounter :
#ce: two-body close encounter with one surrounding, break group too late for hyperbolic (bug) :
#sdjump: slowdown for second binary jump to very large value (bug) :
#5ce: massive B + low-mass B + massive single 5-body encounter (bug of binarytree) :
#eccflip: b-b encounter with one binary eccentricity >1.0 :
