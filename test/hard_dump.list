#6body: 4-body strong encounter :
#ce: two-body close encounter with one surrounding, break group too late for hyperbolic (bug) :
#sdjump: slowdown for second binary jump to very large value (bug) :
#5ce: massive B + low-mass B + massive single 5-body encounter (bug of binarytree) :
#eccflip: b-b encounter with one binary eccentricity >1.0 :
#arerr: 3-body AR quit at a large error phase :
sdissue.flyby: one flyby pass a binary, the timescale criterion depending on radial velocity has inverse peak near peri-center, which cause big energy jump, by using full velocity instead of radial. the problem is solved.
sdissue.flyby2: two binary flyby, the slowdown timescale decrease too slow before the energy error increase too much, use acceleration in timescale calculation help
