Modification Log for PeTar (Long Wang)

1. For thread parallelization, variables belong to individual star can not be in COMMON block.
   Thus, COMMON/KICKSN/ is removed and additional arguments are added to hrdiag and kick (also change in evolv1.f evolv2.f comenv.f)
   kick is an array with the size of 4, first three are x, y, z components of kick velocity, last is the value of velocity.
   In evolve2.f, vkick has 8 members, first and second 4 members are for the first and secondary components, respectively.
2. Array for saving data COMMON block cannot be used, i.e., scm, spp, bcm arrays are removed. 
   Direct writing in data file (10) is used instead. The output interval is controlled by the argument, dtp.
   bpp array now is an argument in evolve2 to store the event information, the array size is fixed to (8,10).
   The stellar type of bpp is modified compare to the original value. The definition is shown in bse.f and bse_interface.h:binary_type.
3. The common block value mxns is moved from /value1/ to /value4/. 
   The common block /value1/ is removed in hrdiag.f to avoid neta rewritting bug. 
   Corresponding changes are also made in evolv1/2.f, mix.f
4. j.eq.1 criterion for call kick in evolve1 is removed to avoid mutiple times call of kick.
5. The common block /TSTEPC/ is removed since not used.
6. trdot.f is added as an extended version of deltat.f (import from NBODY6++) to calculate the next evolv time for a star
7. trflow.f is added to calculate the next evolve time for Roche overflow binary (import from NBODY6++)
